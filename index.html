                <p>Python
                    is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido van
                    Rossum in
                    1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on
                    code
                    readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.
                    Python
                    is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently. </p>
                <h3>What is Python?</h3>
                <p class="double-indent">Python is a high-level, general-purpose, and very popular programming language.
                    Python programming
                    language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, and Machine Learning applications,
                    along
                    with all cutting-edge technology in Software Industry. Python language is being used by almost all
                    tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber… etc.</p>
                <h3>Reason for increasing popularity</h3>
                <ul class="double-list-indent">
                    <li>Emphasis on code readability, shorter codes, ease of writing.</li>
                    <li>Programmers can express logical concepts in fewer lines of code in comparison to languages such
                        as
                        C++ or Java.</li>
                    <li>Python supports multiple programming paradigms, like object-oriented, imperative and functional
                        programming or procedural.</li>
                    <li>There exists inbuilt functions for almost all of the frequently used concepts.</li>

                    Scripting Language
                </header>
                <p>Python is scripting, general-purpose, high-level, and interpreted programming language. It also
                    provides
                    the object-oriented programming approach. </p>
                <h3>What is a scripting language?</h3>
                <p class="double-indent">The scripting language is referred to perform the task based on automating a
                    repeated task. It
                    includes
                    same types of steps while implementing the procedure or program. It reduces time and cuts the costs
                    further.</p>
                <p> The scripting languages are interpreted language instead of a compiled language. The name
                    of
                    few scripting languages is Perl, Visual Basic, JavaScript, Python, Unix Shell Scripts, ECMAScript,
                    and
                    Bash etc.</p>

                    Python Syntax
                </header>
                <p>Python is known for its clean and readable syntax, which makes it an excellent language for
                    beginners,
                    but also powerful enough for advanced applications.Python syntax refers to the set of rules that
                    defines
                    the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured programs in the Python
                    language. These rules make sure that programs written in Python should be structured and formatted,
                    ensuring that the Python interpreter can understand and execute them correctly.</p>
                <h3>Running basic Python program - Hello World!</h3>
                <p class="double-indent">This is the simple printing of hello world in Python.</p>
                <div class=" box box-indent">
                    <Pre><code>print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)</code></Pre>
                </div>
                <p class="double-indent">Output: </p>
                <div class=" box box-indent">
                    <pre>Hello, World!</pre>
                </div>
                <h3>Indentation in Pyhton</h3>
                <p class="double-indent">Python Indentation refers to the use of whitespace (spaces or tabs) at the
                    beginning of a line of
                    code in
                    Python. It is used to define the code blocks. Indentation is crucial in Python because, unlike many
                    other programming languages that use braces “{}” to define blocks, Python uses indentation. It
                    improves
                    the readability of Python code, but on other hand it became difficult to rectify indentation errors.
                    Even one extra or less space can leads to identation error.</p>
                <p class="double-indent">Here is an example of indentation in Python:</p> 
                <div class="box box-indent">
<pre><code>j = 1 
while(j<= 5): 
     print(j) 
     j = j + 1
</code></pre>
                </div>
                <p class="double-indent">Output:</p>
                <div class="box box-indent">
<pre>
1
2
3
4
5

                    Variables
                </header>
                <p>Python Variable is containers that store values. Python is not “statically typed”. We do not need to
                    declare variables before using them or declare their type. A variable is created the moment we first
                    assign a value to it. A Python variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit
                    of
                    storage in a program.</p>
                <p>Example of Variable in Python:</p>
                <div class="box box-indent">
<pre><code>Var = "Geeksforgeeks"
print(Var)
</code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>Output:</p>
                <div class="box box-indent">
                    Geeksforgeeks
                </div>
                <h3>Naming rules for Variables in Pyhton</h3>
                <ul class="double-list-indent">
                    <li>A Python variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.</li>
                    <li>A Python variable name cannot start with a number.</li>
                    <li>A Python variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and
                        _ ).
                    </li>
                    <li>Variable in Python names are case-sensitive (name, Name, and NAME are three different
                        variables).
                    </li>
                    <li>The reserved words(keywords) in Python cannot be used to name the variable in Python.</li>

                <p>Python Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of
                    value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data.</p>
                <p>Since everything is an
                    object in Python programming, Python data types are classes and variables are instances (objects) of
                    these classes.</p>
                <p> The following are the standard or built-in data types in Python:</p>

                    Operators</header>
                <p>In mathematics and computer programming, an operator is a character that represents a specific
                    mathematical or logical action or process.</p>
                <p>In Python programming, Operators in general are used
                    to perform operations on values and variables. These are standard symbols used for logical and
                    arithmetic operations.</p>
                <h3>Types of operators in Python</h3>
                <ul class="double-list-indent">

                <p>Conditional Statements are statements in Python that provide a choice for the control flow based on a
                    condition. It means that the control flow of the Python program will be decided based on the outcome
                    of the condition.</p>

                <p>In computer programming, a loop is a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a
                    certain condition is reached. Typically, a certain process is done, such as getting an item of data
                    and changing it, and then some condition is checked such as whether a counter has reached a
                    prescribed number.</p>

                <p class="double-indent">
                    In Python, a while loop is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition

                <p>Python Lists are just like dynamically sized arrays, declared in other languages (vector in C++ and
                    ArrayList in Java). In simple language, a list is a collection of things, enclosed in [ ] and
                    separated by commas. "The list is a sequence data type which is used to store the collection of
                    data." </p>
